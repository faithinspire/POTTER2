# ✅ CODE IS ALREADY DEPLOYED!

## Status: Code is pushed to Git ✅

The code changes are already in your Git repository. Now you need to:

## STEP 1: Check Render Deployment

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your service
3. Look at "Events" tab
4. Check if deployment is complete
5. Look for "Deploy succeeded" message

**If no recent deployment:**
- Click "Manual Deploy" button
- Select "Deploy latest commit"
- Wait 5 minutes

## STEP 2: Clear Browser Cache (CRITICAL!)

### Chrome/Edge:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "All time"
3. Check "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"

### Firefox:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Everything"
3. Check "Cache"
4. Click "Clear Now"

## STEP 3: Hard Refresh

After clearing cache:
1. Go to your Render URL
2. Press `Ctrl + F5` (hard refresh)
3. Or `Ctrl + Shift + R`

## STEP 4: Test Features

### Test Weekly Payments:
1. Login as agent
2. Go to "Weekly Payments"
3. Click any payment cell
4. Modal should open ✅
5. See calculations ✅
6. Click "Mark as Paid" ✅

### Test Loan Tracker:
1. Login as admin
2. Scroll to "Complete Loan Tracker"
3. See colored status ✅
4. Click any loan row ✅
5. Modal opens with calculations ✅

## Why You're Not Seeing Changes

Most likely reasons:
1. **Browser cache** - Old code is cached
2. **Render not deployed** - Check Render dashboard
3. **Not hard refreshing** - Need Ctrl+F5

## Verify Deployment

Check these:
- [ ] Render shows recent deployment
- [ ] Deployment status is "Live"
- [ ] Browser cache is cleared
- [ ] Used hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- [ ] Tested in incognito window

## Still Not Working?

Try this:
1. Open **incognito/private window**
2. Go to your Render URL
3. Login and test
4. This bypasses all cache

## The Code IS Ready

All these features are in the code:
- ✅ Weekly payments clickable
- ✅ Modal with calculations
- ✅ Loan tracker with colors
- ✅ Mark as paid functionality
- ✅ Automatic balance calculations

You just need to see the NEW code, not the OLD cached version!

**Next Step**: Clear cache, hard refresh, test in incognito window
