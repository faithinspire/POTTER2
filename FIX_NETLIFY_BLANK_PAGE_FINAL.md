## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIX STRATEGY**

I'll create a **hybrid dashboard** that:
1. ✅ **Works on Netlify** (no blank pages)
2. ✅ **Has all your requested features** (branch oversight, photo upload, interest calculation)
3. ✅ **Graceful fallbacks** when API calls fail
4. ✅ **Production-ready** interface

## 🚀 **SOLUTION: ROBUST DASHBOARD**

### **What I'll Fix:**
1. **Make branch oversight optional** - shows when data loads, fallback when it doesn't
2. **Add error boundaries** - prevents crashes
3. **Graceful loading states** - shows loading instead of blank
4. **Fallback data** - shows basic info even if complex queries fail
5. **Keep all new features** - photo upload, interest calculation, etc.
