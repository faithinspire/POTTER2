## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Easy Management:
Use standard passwords:
- **Agent2024!** for all agents
- **Manager2024!** for sub-admins
- Easy to remember and share

### For Better Security:
Use the "Generate" button:
- Creates random 12-character password
- Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
- More secure but harder to remember

### Recommended Workflow:
1. Create user with standard password (Agent2024!)
2. Copy credentials
3. Send to user immediately
4. User logs in
5. (Optional) User changes password later
